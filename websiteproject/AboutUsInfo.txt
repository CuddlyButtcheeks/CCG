Cuddly Cheeks Gaming is more than just a gaming community. This group is meant to be a place where people can get along and experience games like never before. People here
are fun to talk to and are always happy to help out. As you can see, our site is plain and basic, that is because it was written completely by CuddlyButtcheeks and KingFuryan.
Feel like you can help out with the style or processes of the site? Click here to submit a planning and we can discuss the idea intergration. Also at CCG, we want people to
experience Computer Science and be able to get a taste of it. If you would like to learn to code, contact CuddlyButtcheeks at CuddlyButtcheeks@gmail.com, search manofleon on skype
or search cuddlybuttcheeks on kik.
